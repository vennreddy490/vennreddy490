Hi, I’m Venn, a fourth-year Honors Computer Science student at the University of Georgia! I am currently interested in learning about Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence. 

I'm looking for software engineering or financial technology internships to explore the industry and develop experience by collaborating on real-world use projects.
